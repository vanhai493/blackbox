# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating an automated test suite using Robot Framework and Selenium to perform web testing on Wikipedia. The primary functionality is to navigate to Wikipedia, search for specific keywords, and verify the search results. This automation will serve as a foundation for web testing capabilities and can be extended for additional test scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to set up a Robot Framework project with Selenium, so that I can automate web browser interactions for testing purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL have Robot Framework and Selenium libraries properly configured
2. WHEN the test environment is set up THEN the system SHALL be able to launch web browsers programmatically
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Robot Framework libraries for web testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to create a test case that navigates to Wikipedia, so that I can access the Wikipedia homepage for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test case is executed THEN the system SHALL open a web browser
2. WHEN the browser is launched THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Wikipedia homepage (https://www.wikipedia.org)
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL verify that the Wikipedia homepage is displayed correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to search for the keyword "Apple" on Wikipedia, so that I can test the search functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Wikipedia homepage is loaded THEN the system SHALL locate the search input field
2. WHEN the search field is found THEN the system SHALL enter the keyword "Apple"
3. WHEN the keyword is entered THEN the system SHALL submit the search request
4. WHEN the search is submitted THEN the system SHALL wait for the search results page to load

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to verify the search results for "Apple", so that I can confirm the search functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the search results page loads THEN the system SHALL verify that search results are displayed
2. WHEN search results are present THEN the system SHALL verify that the results contain content related to "Apple"
3. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm that the search was successful
4. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL report a test failure with appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want the test to clean up resources after execution, so that the system remains in a clean state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test case completes THEN the system SHALL close the web browser
2. WHEN the browser is closed THEN the system SHALL release all allocated resources
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a test report with results
